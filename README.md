# Algal Bloom Map

Welcome to the Algal Bloom Map! Our mission is to provide accessible and up-to-date information about algal blooms in California waterways. This open-source project aims to enhance public awareness and contribute to the efforts in monitoring and managing algal blooms.

## What is the Algal Bloom Map?
The Algal Bloom Map is a dynamic and interactive tool that visualizes data on current algal bloom reports across California. By aggregating and presenting this information, we aim to help researchers, environmentalists, and the general public stay informed about the locations and severity of algal blooms.

## Why Algal Bloom Monitoring Matters
Algal blooms can have significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems, water quality, and public health. Monitoring and reporting these blooms is crucial for managing their effects and taking preventive measures. Our map serves as a resource for those who need accurate and timely information to address these environmental challenges.
