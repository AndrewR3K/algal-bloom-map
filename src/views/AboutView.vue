      <p class="mb-6">
        Welcome to the Algal Bloom Map! Our mission is to provide accessible and up-to-date
        information about algal blooms in California waterways. This open-source project aims to
        enhance public awareness and contribute to the efforts in monitoring and managing algal
        blooms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What is the Algal Bloom Map?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The Algal Bloom Map is a dynamic and interactive tool that visualizes data on current algal
        bloom reports across California. By aggregating and presenting this information, we aim to
        help researchers, environmentalists, and the general public stay informed about the
        locations and severity of algal blooms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why Algal Bloom Monitoring Matters</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Algal blooms can have significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems, water quality, and public
        health. Monitoring and reporting these blooms is crucial for managing their effects and
        taking preventive measures. Our map serves as a resource for those who need accurate and
        timely information to address these environmental challenges.
